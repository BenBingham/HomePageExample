Parallax Website



This is a website home page that i built following along with Traversy media to learn about implementing the parallax effect, so credit to him. You can see the parallax effect with the photoâ€™s in the background. It was built with sections each having a text body as well as an image in the background. I also learnt through this project how to make the website responsive and adapt to a phone. On the phone/smaller screen version you lose the parallax effect and the pictures scroll in relative order instead. I did this using @media and setting the max-width 568px, so anything smaller than the max width will not have the parallax effect while any screen larger will.

I also began to play around with adding animations through a third party site called Animate.css https://animate.style/#javascript. First through the html then later i added a JavaScript file to trigger animation events at certain times such as when a button is pressed. When you press the shop button it will trigger the event and when the animation ends it will redirect the page back to the main page for now.
